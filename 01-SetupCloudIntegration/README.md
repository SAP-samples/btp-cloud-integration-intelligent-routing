In this step, you will subscribe to SAP Integration Suite and and configure SAP Cloud Integration. 

## Setup SAP Cloud Integration 

1. If you haven't used SAP Business Technology Platform or SAP Cloud Integration, please go to the corresponding SAP Discovery Center Mission. [TODO LINK einfÃ¼gen zu dieser Mission mit Basic Phase](google.com)

2. Go to your SAP BTP Cockpit and make sure that you have two subaccounts in your global account. In this case, we have both of them on Azure - one in West Europe (Netherlands, EU20), one in West US (WA, US20). If you don't have them yet, click on **New Subaccount** in order to create a new subaccount.

> NOTE: If you have two subaccounts in regions where the [SAP Integration Suite is available](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/integration-suite?region=all&tab=service_plan), you don't necessarily need to create separate accounts for this. You can simply reuse the existing ones, if you want.

3. Provide the necessary details for the new subaccount. 

   - Provide a subaccount name. 
   - Optional: Provide a description. 
   - Select Provider **Azure**. 
   - Select Europe (Netherlands) or another region, where SAP Integration Suite is available. The [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/integration-suite?region=all&tab=service_plan) shows the available regions.  
   - Enter a Subdomain for your subaccount. This subdomain becomes part of the URL for accessing applications that you subscribe to from this subaccount.
   - Optional: If your subaccount is to be used for production purposes, select the Use for production option.

**A new tile appears in the global account page with the subaccount details.**

5. Make sure that you have two subaccounts in a region where the SAP Integration Suite is available. If you don't have two subaccounts for SAP Integration Suite yet, create another subaccount as explained in Step 3-4. 

5. In the navigation area of the global account, choose **Entitlements > Entity Assignments** and select the subaccounts in which you want to set up SAP Integration Suite. Continue with **Go**.

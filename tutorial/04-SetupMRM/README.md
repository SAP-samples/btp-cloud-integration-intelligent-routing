# Setup Multi Region Manager (MRM) - SAP CAP Application

### You will learn
 - How to deploy Multi Region Manager (MRM) - SAP CAP Application to SAP BTP 

> ### Prerequisites
> - Make sure you have set up a development environment (that means, youâ€™ve set up SAP Business Application Studio for Development) [as described here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html).
> - Go to your [SAP BTP Cockpit](https://cockpit.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/) and make sure that you have two subaccounts in your global account. In this case, we have both of them on Azure - one in Asia Pacific (AP10), one in US (US10). If you don't have them yet, click on `New Subaccount` in order to create a new subaccount.

>   NOTE: If you already have two subaccounts in different regions, you don't necessarily need to create separate accounts for this tutorial. You can simply reuse the existing ones, if you want. These regions can be from same or different hyperscalers.

"db_mrm_url": "jdbc:h2:mem:mrm",
"db_mrm_username": "sa",
"db_mrm_password": "password",
"db_mrm_platform": "h2",

SAP HANA Cloud Example:
"db_mrm_driverClassName":"com.sap.db.jdbc.Driver",
"db_mrm_url": "jdbc:sap://xxxxxxxxxx.hana.prod-eu20.hanacloud.ondemand.com:443?encrypt=true&validateCertificate=true&currentschema=MRM",
"db_mrm_username": "MRM_F2SS5P5306K7RT24P1GQKOM9R_RT",
